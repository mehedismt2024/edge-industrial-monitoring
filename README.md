# Edge Industrial Monitoring

## Overview
This repository presents research-oriented prototypes and experimental
artifacts developed to explore edge-centric approaches for industrial
monitoring in manufacturing environments. The work emphasizes system-
level architecture, device-level data acquisition concepts, and local
processing strategies suitable for resource-constrained or connectivity-
limited settings.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To investigate scalable and low-complexity architectures for industrial
  monitoring at the edge
- To evaluate local data processing and visualization concepts without
  reliance on continuous cloud connectivity
- To support academic research and experimental validation in smart
  manufacturing contexts

## Scope and Limitations
This repository is intended strictly for academic and experimental use.
It does not constitute a complete or production-ready industrial system.
Key functional components—including core algorithms, optimization logic,
intelligent decision modules, and deployment-specific configurations—are
intentionally omitted or abstracted.
